Self-Review Exercises

7.1
Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:

a) All scripts can be written in terms of three types of control statements: ________, ________ and ________.
b) The ________ double-selection statement is used to execute one action when a condition is true and another action when that condition is false.
c) Repeating a set of instructions a specific number of times is called ________ repetition.
d) When itâ€™s not known in advance how many times a set of statements will be repeated, a(n) ________ (or a(n) ________, ________ or ________) value can be used to terminate the repetition.
7.2
Write four JavaScript statements that each add 1 to variable x, which contains a number.

7.3
Write JavaScript statements to accomplish each of the following tasks:

a) Assign the sum of x and y to z, and increment the value of x by 1 after the calculation. Use only one statement.
b) Test whether the value of the variable count is greater than 10. If it is, print "Count is greater than 10".
c) Decrement the variable x by 1, then subtract it from the variable total. Use only one statement.
d) Calculate the remainder after q is divided by divisor, and assign the result to q. Write this statement in two different ways.
7.4
Write a JavaScript statement to accomplish each of the following tasks:

a) Declare variables sum and x.
b) Assign 1 to variable x.
c) Assign 0 to variable sum.
d) Add variable x to variable sum, and assign the result to variable sum.
e) Print "The sum is: ", followed by the value of variable sum.
7.5
Combine the statements you wrote in Exercise 7.4 into a script that calculates and prints the sum of the integers from 1 to 10. Use the while statement to loop through the calculation and increment statements. The loop should terminate when the value of x becomes 11.

7.6
Determine the value of each variable after the calculation is performed. Assume that, when each statement begins executing, all variables have the integer value 5.

a) product *= x++;
b) quotient /= ++x;
7.7
Identify and correct the errors in each of the following segments of code:

a)
while ( c <= 5 ) {
   product *= c;
   ++c;
b)
if ( gender == 1 )
   document.writeln( "Woman" );
else;
   document.writeln( "Man" );
7.8
What is wrong with the following while repetition statement?

while ( z >= 0 )
   sum += z;

Answers
7.1
a) Sequence, selection and repetition.
b) if...else.
c) Counter-controlled (or definite).
d) Sentinel, signal, flag or dummy.
7.2
x = x + 1;
x += 1;
++x;
x++;
7.3
a) z = x++ + y;
b)
if ( count > 10 )
   document.writeln( "Count is greater than 10" );
c) total -= --x;
d)
q %= divisor;
q = q % divisor;
7.4
a) var sum, x;
b) x = 1;
c) sum = 0;
d) sum += x; or sum = sum + x;
e) document.writeln( "The sum is: " + sum );
7.5
The solution is as follows:
Answer below is correct

7.6
a) product = 25, x = 6;
b) quotient = 0.833333..., x = 6;
7.7
a) Error: Missing the closing right brace of the while body. Correction: Add closing right brace after the statement ++c;.
b) Error: The ; after else causes a logic error. The second output statement always executes. Correction: Remove the semicolon after else.
7.8
The value of the variable z is never changed in the body of the while statement. Therefore, if the loop-continuation condition (z >= 0) is true, an infinite loop is created. To prevent the creation of the infinite loop, z must be decremented so that it eventually becomes less than 0.


7.1
a) Sequence Structure, Control Structure, and Repetition Structure
b) if/else
c) Counter-Controlled Repetition
d) sentinel or signal value, dummy value, or flag value

7.2
x++;, ++x;, x += 1;, x = x + 1;

7.3
a) z = x++ + y;
b) if (count > 10) {document.writeln("<p>Count is greater than 10</p>")}
c) total -= --x;
d) q %= divisor;, q = q%divisor;

7.4
a) var sum, x;
b) x = 1;
c) sum = 0;
d) sum += x;
e) document.writeln("<p>The sum is: " + sum + "</p>");

7.5 +
var sum = 0;
var x = 1;
while(x < 11) {
	sum += x;
	x++;
}
document.writeln("<p>The sum is: " + sum + "</p>");

7.6
a) product = 25, x = 6
b) quotient = 5/6, x = 6

7.7
a) Need to initialize variables
 - Missing closing brace
var product = 1;
var c = 1;
while ( c <= 5 ) {
   product *= c;
   ++c;
}
b) Fix equality sign and initialize variable. If the input is take from user, make sure it is parsed
 - Remove semicolon from else
var gender;
if ( parseInt(gender) === 1 )
   document.writeln( "Woman" );
else
   document.writeln( "Man" );

7.8
z doesn't change, so if it was initialized > 0, then the loop will run infinitely. Need to decrement z value
while ( z >= 0 )
   sum += z;
