e) Prompt the user to enter the second value, read the value from the user and store it in the variable yVal.
f) Prompt the user to enter the third value, read the value from the user and store it in the variable zVal.
g) Convert the string xVal to an integer, and store the result in the variable x.
h) Convert the string yVal to an integer, and store the result in the variable y.
i) Convert the string zVal to an integer, and store the result in the variable z.
j) Compute the product of the three integers contained in variables x, y and z, and assign the result to the variable result.

6.6
Using the statements you wrote in Exercise 6.5, write a complete script that calculates and prints the product of three integers.

6.1
a) //
b) ;
c) if
d) window
e) key - keywords
f) ???? - write, writeln, document

6.2
a) False. Comments are not read by the computer
b) False. They are different. Casing matters
c) True.
d) False, + and - have lower precedence
e) False. Converts a string into an int

6.3
a) var c, thisIsAVariable, q76354, number;
b) window.prompt("Please Enter an Integer", "0");
c) var age = parseInt(stringValue);
d) 
if (praseInt(number) !== 7) {
	window.alert("The variable number is not equal to 7");
}
e) document.writeln("<p>This is JavaScript</p>");

6.4
a) Remove semicolon from if statement
if ( c < 7 )
	window.alert( "c is less than 7" );
b) Should be >= instead of =>
if ( c => 7 )
	window.alert( "c is equal to or greater than 7" );

6.5
a) // Calculate product of 3 integers
b) var x, y, z, result;
c) var xVal, yVal, zVal;
d) xVal = window.prompt("Please enter your first value");
e) yVal = window.prompt("Please enter your second value");
f) zVal = window.prompt("Please enter your third value");
g) x = parseInt(xVal);
h) y = parseInt(yVal);
i) z = parseInt(zVal);
j) result = x * y * z;
k) document.writeln("<p>The product is " + result + "</p>");

6.6
