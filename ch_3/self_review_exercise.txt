3.2
State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.

a) Any particular HTML5 form input types must render identically in every HTML5-compliant browser.
b) When the focus is placed in the text field (i.e., the cursor is in the text field), the placeholder text is submitted to the server.
c) You do not need to include autofocus in your forms.
d) The new HTML 5 input types are self validating on the client side, eliminating the need to add complicated scripts to your forms to validate user input and reducing the amount of invalid data submitted.
e) The range input type is inherently self-validating when it’s rendered by the browser as a slider control, because the user is unable to move the slider outside the bounds of the minimum or maximum value.
f) HTML5 self validates the tel input type.
g) If the user enters an improperly formatted URL in a url input type, it will not validate. HTML5 does not validate that the URL entered actually exists.
h) The nav element displays a drop-down menu of hyperlinks.
i) The header element may be used only one time on a page.
j) nav elements can be nested in an aside element.
k) You might use the brk to prevent awkward word breaks.

a) hexadecimal code.
b) placeholder.
c) submit.
d) required.
e) spinner.
f) time.
g) datalist.
h) article.
i) footer.
j) wbr.
3.2
a) False. The rendering of input types can vary among browsers.
b) False. When the focus is placed in the text field, the placeholder text disappears. It’s not “submitted” when the user clicks the Submit button (unless the user types the same text).
c) True.
d) True.
e) True.
f) False. The length and format of telephone numbers varies greatly based on location, making validation quite complex, so HTML5 does not self validate the tel input type. To ensure that the user enters a phone number in a proper format, we use the pattern attribute.
g) True.
h) False. The nav element groups navigation links.
i) False. The header element may be used multiple times on a page and often includes HTML headings (<h1> through <h6>)
j) True.
k) False. You might use the wbr to prevent awkward word breaks.

3.2
a) False: The elements are placed in the browser by the html code, but is rendered differently in different browsers depending on the browser +
b) False: Placeholder text is not submitted to the server, it only disappears +
c) True: Autofocus is optional for the selection of an input on loading the page +
d) True: Reduces work for validation, but server-side validation is still required +
e) True: The range input has limits due to the slider, where the user cannot move the slider past the specified range +
f) False: The tel input types can only specify formatting for the inputs / There are many phone number formats, which make it difficult to accomodate for, so self-validation was avoided
g) True: No validation for if the URL exists or not, only checks the formatting of the entered URL +
h) False: It groups a list of hyperlinks and is not a drop-down menu of hyperlinks +
i) False: The header element can be used as many times as desired on one page +
j) True: Many things can be nested inside an aside +
k) False: Use a wbr to break words and prevent awkward word breaks +
