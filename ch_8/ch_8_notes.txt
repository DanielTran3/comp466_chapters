Case-Switch
	Controlling Expression: Value used inside the Switch/Case statement -> switch(<controlling expression>)
	Case Labels: The different cases

	Note: If break is not used anywhere in a switch statement, then each time a match occurs in the statement, the statements for that case and all the remaining cases execute.

Logical Operators
	The && operator has a higher precedence than the || operator

	Short-Circuit Evaluation: If the first statement in a logical AND expression is False, then the rest of the expression is not evaluated. If the first statement in a logical OR expression is True, then the rest of the expression is not evaluated. This is done for performance optimizations.

	Nonzero numeric values are considered to be true. The numeric value zero is considered to be false.
	Any string that contains characters is considered to be true. The empty string (i.e., the string containing no characters) is considered to be false.
	The value null and variables that have been declared but not initialized are considered to be false. 
	All objects (such as the browser’s document and window objects and JavaScript’s Math object) are considered to be true.
